# NACA 4-digit parametric airfoil
# Leading edge point in origin, unit chord along x axis, 10 degree washout angle.
# If a smooth surface is more important than a strict adherence to
# the original NACA geometry, set SmoothingPasses to a non-zero value (typically
# 1 or 2).
#
# NOTE: you may have to hit 'zoom extents' to bring the airfoil into view.
